		<p>One of the first passions I had since I was a child is space, space has always fascinated
		and intrigued me with its wonders and misteries. I dreamed of becoming an astronaut and exploring the stars,
		planets and galaxies. space is for me a source of ispiration and knowledge, a challenge for humanity and Science. 
		<br>That's why I put the willingness to search for NASA space missions<p>

		<p>Another passion of mine is music, music has always been a part of my life and way to express myself. I love 
		listening to different genres and artists. Music is for me a form of art and communication, a means to connect with others 
		and with myself. <br>That's why I put the availability to search for spotify songs</p>
